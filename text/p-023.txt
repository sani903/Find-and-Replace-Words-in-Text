2.4 Overview

Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) has hundred and twenty-five tonnes of composite
propellant cast into its first stage alone. Since solid propellants have their own
oxidizer and fuel, they can be ignited by chance thereby posing a serious fire hazard.
As such, great care is taken in handling propellants for rocket applications. More
about the way propellants burn and the way to control them will be discussed later.

2.4 Overview

There are natural fuels and synthetic fuels and natural and synthetic oxidizers.
The most abundant fuels are biomass or biomass-related. Synthetic fuels are used
for special applications like rocket propulsion. Most fuels are based on carbon,
hydrogen, with some oxygen and nitrogen. They are available in gaseous, liquid
and solid forms.

The most natural oxidizer is oxygen present in air. Examples of synthetic oxi-
dizers are liquid oxygen, or specially prepared inorganic liquid or solid compounds.

There are many properties of the fuels/oxidizers which matter in their selection
for a specific purpose. The most important property is the energy content of the
substance. It decides how high the combustion temperature will be. It is also im-
portant to know the quantity of oxidizer required to be mixed with a given amount
of fuel in order to obtain peak combustion temperature. This is called stoichiometry
and is discussed next.
