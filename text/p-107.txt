The quantity (u4cpe/k,) is the Prandtl number with a value of 0.75-0.8 for com-
bustible gas mixtures. (Nu/Nuyg), the blocking effect can be calculated exactly for
several laminar flows. For turbulent flows, it can be calculated only empirically.
It goes like In(1 + B)/B for small values of B. Typical values of B for some liquid
and solid fuels are shown in Table 10.1. For larger values, typically B ~ 5 or more,
the expression (Nu/Nug) can be written as Cy Bb. This form is curve fitted to
compute values of (Nu/Nug). and Cy and m are estimated.

The final result in several situations can therefore be written as

The expression for Nu for the situations identified earlier are set out in Table 10.2.
One can take a typical case. For flat plate, stagnation point flows (flows in which

fluid impinges normal to a flat plate, for instance) at Low Reynolds number,
ppt (pV )oo = CoB™ Pr=*/* Re? (10.33)

where x is the distance from the leading edge or stagnation point.

For turbulent flows, it varies as

poi (pV )oo = CoB™Pr=2/3 Re; 0/2 (10.34)

For laminar free convective flows the mass burn rate will vary like

pp = CoB™ (ky / cpg) (GrPr)t/4 (10.35)
