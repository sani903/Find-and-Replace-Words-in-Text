10 Diffusion Flames

flame will sustain the heat transfer to the liquid surface enabling its vaporization
before reacting with the oxidant at the flame.

One can obtain from the solution procedure, Ty = HY} /sc, + To.

In the above expression, s is the स्टोइकोमेट्रिक ratio (same as 1/f;) and other
terms have the same meaning as in the previous case. If we now take similar
numbers but include a few more needed for combustion, 7), = 800 K, T; = 300 K, k,
=0.03 W/mK, c, = 1.2 kJ/kgK, p; = 800 kg/m3, H=42 M J/kg, s = 3.5, Yoo = 0.232,
L = 300 kJ/kg (typical values for kerosene drop burning in air), r,o = 1 mm, we get
tet, = 2.7.

One can see that the time for combustion is much smaller than that for vapori-
sation and this is dominantly affected by the transfer number and mean transport
property effects.

There is a minor point concerning the above results. In the case of combustion
or vaporisation at high ambient temperatures, the liquid temperature will increase
from ambient to a value close to the boiling point. This heat is to be included in the
denominator of the expression for B. by replacing L with (L + mc, (dTs/dt)/m)

The second term approaches zero within a short time during droplet burning.

One can now ask what are the influences of free and forced convection on mass
burn rate. One bases the answers on semi-empirical approaches as of now, since
the problem will be two-dimensional (unlike spherical symmetry leading to one-
dimension) and the soultion quite involved.

Studies indicate that
M free con / Mog = (1 + 0.2B;%41Gr03) (10.20)

where
Gr = Grashof number = 82, g(T} — Tp) /v*T, (10.21)
is the ratio of gravitational to viscous forces.

The extent of increase in the mass burn rate because of free convection can be as
large as 20-40% compared to those under zero-g conditions, depending on the initial
drop radius. This is the value of burn rate observed if one conducts experiments on
droplets in a laboratory without any special equipment for zero-g application.

In the case of forced convection (laminar)
Th forced con 0g = (1+ 0.3Pr'/3 Rel/?) (10.22)

where Re = 2p,Vrs,/ 114 is the Reynolds number.

Whenever forced convection dominates the flow, Reynolds number becomes the
parameter characterizing the flow features and it will appear as a principal variable
(more like Re'/? for laminar flows).
