10 Diffusion Flames

their height depends on diffusion and diffusion rates are small. Laminar gas dif-
fusion flame heights increase with velocity. Turbulent flames scale with diameter
of jet. Diffusion flame heights and heat transfer are relatively independent of pres-
sure.

Liquid fuel droplet combustion in oxidising environment occupies a premier po-
sition in industrial and automotive engine combustion situations. Droplet combus-
tion times scale with square of initial diameter in zero-g conditions. Usually, d’>—
law, as the basic relation is called, is obeyed even with free convection or moderate
forced convection. The thermal properties of the liquid fuel do not have a signifi-
cant influence on the burn rate. Drop combustion times are two to ten times smaller
than vaporisation times under similar ambient conditions. Corrections to burn rate
because of velocity of oxidizer or free convection arc made by semi-empirical means
through the use of Re!/2 or Grl/* as the appropriate terms (in the laminar range).

Boundary layer diffusive combustion is another major combustion mode. It is
relevant in hybrid rockets and fire in a variety of situations. A general analysis
technique shows that the mass burn rate (or mass flux to be precise) varies with
transfer number (to account for thermodynamic effects) and Nusselt number (to ac-
count for flow effects). The inter-relation between flow and thermodynamic effects
occurs because of the blocking effect—the effect of reduction in heat transfer due
to enhancement of mass efflux from the surface. A general statement of these rela-
tions is possible so that a variety of physical flow conditions can be accounted. Lam-
inar flow situations can be analysed exactly—sometimes using a computer. Turbu-
lent flow situations need modelling of turbulence-reaction interactions. This area is
not fully understood yet. For engineering needs, correlations can be developed and
these are indeed satisfactory in many cases.
