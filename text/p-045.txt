about 30% excess air, then carbon monoxide becomes negligible. At A/F of 30 or
beyond, the only products are H,O, CO,, Ny and excess Os. It is under these condi-
tions that the approximations made earlier for the calculation of flame temperature
in the example are valid.

One can notice that the molecular weight of gases is lower for fuel-rich condi-
tions and achieves the value of air at oxidizer-rich conditions.

The typical values of temperature for several common fuel and oxidizer combi-
nations are shown in Table 4.8. The flame temperature does not depend signifi-
cantly on the nature of hydrocarbon fuel as long as the oxidizer is air. It is about
2300+50 K. Replacing air by oxygen raises the temperature by 600-800 K. In-
crease in initial temperature does not raise the flame temperature by the same
increment. It is particularly true for flame temperatures beyond 3000 K, because
most of the energy goes into dissociating the stable molecules so that the tempera-
ture does not change much. Increase in pressure is helpful in reducing dissociation,
thereby causing a rise in flame temperature. The change in flame temperature,
again, beyond some pressure is very limited because the change in composition
beyond pressures of 5.0—-8.0 M Pa is not much. Acetylene with its high heat of for-
mation has a flame temperature with air distinctly higher than other straight chain
hydrocarbons.
