level but poorly at high altitudes, this being related to lower boiling point at higher
altitudes).

Liquid petroleum gas is composed of a few chemical species like propane and
butane which are composed of the chemical elements C and H. The primary com-
ponent, butane , has a boiling point of —0.5°C' at 0.1 M Pa. Therefore it is gas at
ambient temperature. As pressure reaches 0.6 M Pa, the boiling point is raised to
26°C. If the ambient temperature is 20°C but the pressure 0.6 M Pa, you see that
Butane has to be in liquid form. If ambient temperature reaches 35°C, then the
pressure inside the cylinder will become 0.8 M Pa and both liquid and gas exist in
equilibrium. At typical draw rates of the gas in cooking stoves—0.03-0.05 g/s (108—
180 g/h), the cylinder is able to maintain the flow rate without any loss of pressure
because it will compensate for the heat of vaporisation of the liquid by drawing heat
from the ambient.

However, if you draw much larger flow rates—something which can be done in a
combustion laboratory and should be avoided at home—the cooling effect dominates
and the pressure in the cylinder will begin to fall. Consequently, water drops form
on the outer surface of the cylinder due to condensation of atmospheric moisture,
reducing the gas flow drastically.

The composition of LPG depends on the source of the crude used for refining and
the effort put into refining it. Table 2.2 shows a typical composition and density of
LPG. Notice that it is much lighter than water, in fact close to half of it.

Next we take up biogas. Biogas is produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass.
Its use has gone up significantly in the last decade, and in several parts of India,
