4.1 The Second Law

drive by itself along the path. If ds = 0, then the system is at equilibrium and no
further change takes place.

Thus the second law introduces a quantity called entropy whose change will give
a direction of process. Second law does not define the absolute value of entropy. It
is defined by the third law which states that entropy of a crystalline substance is
zero at absolute zero temperature. Using the data on specific heats and enthalpies,
entropy is calculated for various species and presented in Table 4.4 for the same
species.

For closed systems operating at constant pressure and temperature, the quan-
tity that indicates direction of processes is called Gibbs free energy. It is defined as
g = h — Ts so that

dg = dh — Tds — sdT = dh — Tds (4.21)

Since dT = 0 and dg < 0 for natural processes, is equal to 0 for equilibrium, greater
than 0 for processes which do not take place by themselves.

It can be seen that when dh = 0, the principles noted above with respect to g are
equivalent to those of entropy. The fact that dg = 0 at equilibrium is used in the
calculation of chemical composition at constant pressure and temperature. Armed
with the basic information we now have, we begin answering two questions:

Will the reaction proceed along a direction indicated? What is the composition
for a given set of reactants at a given pressure and temperature? Let us take an
example. Is NoO(g) — Na(g) + (1/2)0O2(g), at 300 K, 0.1M Pa a natural reaction?

To do this we compute g,,s — gins and see if it is positive, or negative. Depending
on this value we declare the reaction to be not natural, at equilibrium or natural.

hins = h + hs n,0(300) — hs N,0(298.16) =81.6 kJ

hens = hf + (1/2) f.0, +h, (300) — hg ny (298.16) + (1/2) hs 0, (300) — his 0, (298.16) = 0
AS = [Sn, + (1/2)So, — Sn,0](298.16) = (0.191 + 0.102 — 0.2198) = 0.074 kJ/K
rhs — gins = —81.6 — 0.074 x 298.16 = —103 kJ = Ag

Ag is negative and hence the reaction must be a natural one.

In making these calculations the data on heats of formation, sensible enthalpies
and entropies have been used. These are taken from Tables 4.1 to 4.3. Let us take
another example. Consider H2O (I,0.1 M Pa) — H50 (g,0.1 M Pa).

The question is at what temperature is this transformation (called vaporisation)
a natural one.

(9m,0(9) — IH200)) <0
(hH,0(9) — has00)) + T(SH0(9) — SH200)) <0
T > (ha,0(9) — hHs00))/ (SH0(9) — SHO)
