5.1 How Fast Does a Reaction Take Place?

One can write

de; /dt = (a, — a;)w""

. aj;
where ww" = k lle;

k is the constant = A;T” exp(— E/RT) and the symbol II refers to the product of the
subscripted quantity over all the species. c; = species concentration (moles/volume).
This relationship is called the law of mass action. It describes the rate of reaction
as a function of species concentrations, and a constant dependent on temperature.
If the reverse reaction Ya; A; = Ya, A; is involved and if one uses equation of state
and relationships between molar and mass fractions, one gets

 

 

dY; .# RT Yi; p 1% Yd; p 1%
= TT kx | 2222 Z| kdl | HL 4
dt 2 pn [Br Ea B54

Where the first and second terms within the parenthesis sign are the rates of
forward and backward reactions.

Now if steady state or equilibrium is attained, one gets dY;/dt = 0 and so

ky Villy D(a
oH Ema) — |g) = Ko (T :
ky ( WH wT) J p p(T) (5.5)

Thus one can note that equilibrium constant is obtained in the limit of reaction
rates in a reversible reaction going to zero. Equation 5.4 can be written as

DRT, p15 1 Yd]
= iy mh “wm 7 Rr

The unknown parameters of chemical rates are A; and Ein ky = Ayexp(—E;/RT).
These are usually determined from specially performed experiments. Since the
reaction rates are very large and the reaction times are very small (a few micro
seconds to a tenth of a millisecond or so), transient instrumentation techniques are
used to obtain the data. Once ky, is known, the backward rate k;, is obtained from
equilibrium constant which is known from thermodynamics, the data being specific
heats and entropies.

 

 

 

Some features of the reaction rate expression are interesting. Typical values of
the activation energy FE are of the order of 100-150 kJ/mol for most hydrocarbon-
oxygen reactions. If we examine the dependence of reaction rate on temperature,

we can write
RRr, /RRy, = e B/BT1 j= E/T (5.6)

For E/R = 5000 K (note R = 8.346 J/mol K)

RRs0or/RRss0i = 079% = 2.46 (5.7)
