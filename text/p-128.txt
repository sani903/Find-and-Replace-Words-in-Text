Cost It is important that one does not ignore the cost of the system. Be it the
aircraft gas turbine engine or a domestic stove, cost factors drive the designer
to make more optimal choices.

13.1 The Devices

The various combustion devices commonly used are gas stove, kerosene stove, wood
burning stove, gas burner, liquid fuel burners for furnaces, special purpose burners,
coal combustion devices and gas turbine combustor.

Some of these have been discussed in earlier chapters; but we will examine them
briefly here.

Gas Stove In gas stoves, the jet of fuel issuing from the tiny hole entrains air and
moves up, comes out of the head where it is ignited (Fig.13.1). Once ignited,
the flame is stable and largely bluish over the range of flow rates permitted
by the valve. The process of entrainment is not complete or satisfactory as
may happen if the internal passage carrying the fuel-air mixture is somewhat
blocked. In such a case, the fuel flow rate is not affected but the flow rate
of air entrained will not be adequate. In this case, the fuel-air mixture will
be slightly fuel-rich and one may end up with yellow tongued flames. One
will also have the problem of sooting locally if the mixture is largely fuel-rich.
Combustion efficiencies in these stoves is close to 96-98 % in most situations.
The efficiency of energy utilization controlled by heat transfer efficiency is
about 75 % in the best situation. This efficiency is dependent on vessel shape
and size. Flat bottomed vessels of diameter of about three times the diameter
of the flame give the highest possible efficiencies.

Kerosene Stove In the case of kerosene stove, it must be said that the design using
perforated cylindrical sheets is ingenious and deceptively simple, as stated
