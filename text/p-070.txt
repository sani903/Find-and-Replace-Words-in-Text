If we further note that uw}'d; = (k/c,), we get

Experimental measurements seem to confirm the above relationship between
quench distance and flame speed. The proportionality constant, C, varies between
10 and 30. The dependence of quench distance on pressure and initial temperature
is essentially through the laminar flame thickness of flame speed. This implies

dg ~ pp"? and dg ~ e~F/2RTy (7.5)

Typically, n ~ 2 and so d; ~ 1/p. The dependence on initial temperature is felt
through its effect on the flame temperature. Typical values of quench distance for
some gases are shown in Table 7.2.

One can notice from Table 7.2 that the lowest quench distance is as low as 0.2
mm. Thus it is difficult to prevent Ho—O, flame from moving across any barrier in
ducts.

What do we use the information on inflammability limits and quenching dis-
tances for?

The information on inflammability limits is useful for causing ignition as well
as preventing fires. If a fuel-oxidant mixture needs to be ignited, it must lie within
the limits of flammability. Thus, one simple check to determine if a mixture is ig-
nitable is to examine the limits of flammability. There are occasions where one does
not want a mixture to ignite. One practical instance is as follows. Most submarines
have a device to surface fast from depths in case of an emergency. Typically, the
time to surface from 200 m depth may be about 20-30 s. For doing this, its interior
regions filled with water are expelled by a gas generator based on hydrazine which
