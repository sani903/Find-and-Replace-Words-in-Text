16.6 Overview

This chapter has considered the aspects related to gaseous emissions from combus-
tion devices — why they are pollutants, how they are generated and how to reduce
them. Excepting CO, which is a major product of combustion (constituting about
15 % by volume of the products of combustion cooled to ambient conditions), most
others are found at very low levels (parts per billion as in the case of dioxins, parts
per million for nitric oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). The aim
is to reduce the total magnitude of emissions by consuming a smaller amount of fuel
for the same job, be it a furnace or an engine and next, by reducing the pollutant
per unit magnitude of the fuel. Both aspects are interesting, but the second one
is more challenging. The pathways by which these small amounts of irritants are
generated are subtly arranged by Nature and uncovering them is a fulfilling task —
the formation of soot in these systems is a case in point.

In many practical systems, turbulence in the flow becomes an important feature
to be accounted for in the calculation of the emissions. In many systems, combining
the chemical pathways with fluid flow provides ways of predicting the pollutants by
computational procedures when such predictive procedures are combined with data
from selected prototype systems.
