these variations. Problems of tar generation are far more serious with bio-fuels
compared to coal since the volatile content in bio-fuels is very much higher.

The hot gas has to be cooled and cleaned for use in advanced combustion systems
and engines. The typical demand of high throughput engines in terms of tar and
particulate matter is that they should be less than a few ppm in order that the
engines operate on producer gas just as well as with natural gas.

15.2 Overview

This chapter has considered the thermal conversion processes for solid fuels. The
recognition that solid fuels are generally of varying shapes and sizes with different
moisture and ash content is important for designing a combustion system that is
expected to be efficient with minimum gaseous emissions. One general principle
is to convert the solid fuels into gaseous fuels so that combustion control is better
exercised. Also, when the solid fuels are converted to clean gaseous fuels, it is
possible to use them for mechanical power generation (and thereby, electricity) as
well as for high grade heat.

Combustion devices looked at in this chapter are moving grate system, bubbling
and circulating fluid beds. Fluid bed systems allow better thermal and emission
control.

Gasification devices are fixed bed systems, bubbling and circulating fluid bed
systems. Fixed bed gasifiers can be updraft or downdraft.
