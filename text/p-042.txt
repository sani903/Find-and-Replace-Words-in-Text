small concentration at certain temperatures, one might simplify the problem by
dropping the species altogether. This reduces the number of equations to be solved.

The equilibrium relations and element conservation equations are solved to-
gether to obtain the composition. These equations constitute a set of nonlinear
algebraic equations whose size is large even for 2 or 3 elements. From the early
sixties to the seventies, several attempts were made to solve such equations by
various means and a very powerful computer technique was developed at NASA
in the early seventies. This is a workhorse programme used all over the world in
obtaining the equilibrium composition (and adiabatic flame temperature as well).
This programme minimizes the Gibbs free energy (at p = constant, T' = constant) to
obtain the equilibrium composition.

4.3 How Do We Obtain Flame Temperature

We have laid the foundations for calculating the flame temperature. We make an
important and reasonably good approximation: the flame temperature is attained
as in an adiabatic situation. This implies that no heat is lost to the surroundings
from the system. This situation is typified in Fig. 4.1.

The reactants are kept in an isolated cylinder with a piston to simulate the pres-
sure. Then they are sparked to initiate ignition. After this the reactions proceed
to completion. The temperature rises to adiabatic flame temperature. The calcula-
tions are made using of the idea described in Fig. 4.2.

A first estimate of adiabatic flame temperature is made. Then the composition is
