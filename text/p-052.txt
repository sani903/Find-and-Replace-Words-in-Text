5 How Does a Reaction Proceed? At What Rate?

with Os and dissociation of Hs takes place. This feature is generalized in the third
reaction. Here H> reacts with AM giving Hydrogen atoms and M. M represents any
molecule in the field. In reaction (4), HO reacts with O to give O, and H. Here one
bond is broken and another made. It is a little more difficult than a simple event of
breaking or making of a bond. In reaction (5) three species meet at a single location
leading to products. These reactions, called three body reactions, are not usual at
low or reasonable pressures. The density of the gas has to be very high in order
for the molecules to be, on an average, close to each other so that three species can
meet at a point at the same time. Now we can see why a reaction like

C3H6 + 509 — 3C02 + 4H20 (propane oxidation)

cannot take place in one step. Notice that propane molecule is very large with eight
hydrogen atoms attached at various points. For the reaction to take place, five
oxygen molecules have to meet one propane molecule at the same time, break it up
such that all eight molecules are pulled out and the carbon atoms separated from
each other to form three molecules of CO; and four molecules of HO. In effect,
15 bonds are to be broken and 14 bonds are to be made. An obviously impossible
task considering the fact that in a normal situation, one or two bonds are broken or
made. What actually happens is that C5Hg, reacts with some energetic atom like
H or O which will first break a bond to form C3H7; and Hs or OH. Such a process
will continue till very small molecules are formed (like CH for instance). Most of
these species like C3H7, C3H6 are all short-lived unstable configurations and end
up quickly as small molecules which will get oxidized to products.

What is clear from this discussion is that chemical reaction proceeds along
molecular events. The making or breaking of a bond is the simplest event. The
next complex event is the making of two bonds, breaking of two bonds or making of
a bond and breaking of another. This is followed by the event in which three bonds
being made/ broken (or some combination of these happenings).

The reaction paths for a simple reaction system like H2 O2, are many. Typically
they are as follows:

H2+M — H+ H+ M Chain initiation
O2+M—->0+0+M

H2 +O — OH + H Chain branching

Oy + H — OH +O Chain branching
H+0Oy4+M— HO; + M

HO + Oy — HOy + O Chain branching

HO+O+ M — HOy+ M Chain carrying

HO+ H+ M — HO + M Chain termination

H+O+M — HO + M Chain termination
