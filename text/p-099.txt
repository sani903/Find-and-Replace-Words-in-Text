boundary conditions. The boundaries are the surface of the droplet, r = r, and
r — 00, the infinite outer boundary. The droplet is at temperature 7, and the outer
region is at Tj. For vaporisation to occur, Tp must be larger than T;. Let us for the
moment assume that the surface temperature of the droplet, T; is constant all the
time.

Thus for T(r = rs) = Ts, and T(r — oo) — Tp, the solution can be obtained. An
additional condition is required to calculate the vaporisation rate. For this purpose,
one needs to strike a heat balance at the liquid surface like

ame =mlL, (10.9)
rl,

where L = heat of phase change. This equation states that the heat transferred
from the outer region to the surface is balanced by the heat taken away by the
vaporising substance/liquid. Such an equation is indeed common in the solution
process of combustion problems.

The solution of eqn. (10.8) subject to the boundary conditions noted above along
with the condition (10.9) gives

m = 4rrs(k/cp)gIn(1 + By) (10.10)

The subscript ¢g on k/c, is to indicate that it is to be obtained for the gas phase. In
the above equation, B, is expressed as

By = c,(Th — Ty) /L (10.11)

The quantity B, is called transfer number and it indicates the thermodynamic po-
tential to cause vaporisation. k is the thermal conductivity (transport property) and
cp is constant pressure specific heat of gas.
