the front end of the surface and the viscosity of the fluid. These quantities can be
combined to form a Reynolds number (Re = pUx/u). The thickness of boundary
layer (4,) can be shown to vary with Reynolds number as

8y/x ~ Re? (10.23)

The exponent — 1/2 on Reynolds number is typical of all laminar flows.

At very high speeds of the fluid flow, or large distances from the front edge,
the flow no longer remains laminar, but becomes turbulent. Though they are not
understood at fundamental level, yet much is known about their overall behaviour—
certainly enough for engineers to carry out their designs pretty well. For these flows
the boundary layer thickness varies with Reynolds number as

Sy ~ Re 02 (10.24)

Combustion in the boundary layer occurs when the oxidizer flows past a solid sur-
face or a surface supplied with liquid fuel or a large liquid fuel mass.

Figure 10.3 indicates the features of laminar boundary layer combustion. The
temperature profile shows a peak temperature at the flame (2000-2500 K) and
drops to ambient temperature on one side and relatively high surface temperature
(600-800 K) on the other side. The zone between fuel surface and flame has fuel
vapour and products diffusing towards this side from the flame. The zone above the
