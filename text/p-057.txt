numbers are at best known to an accuracy of a factor of 10 and the activation energy
to an accuracy of 20-30%. (See Table 5.1 for data on several reactions and their rate
data.) So, it was argued, there was not much point in making accurate calculations
because the data were so uncertain. In the last Fifteen years, chemical kineti-
cists have improved the accuracy of data of many elementary s and it has become
worthwhile making detailed calculations. Some of the spectacular advances will be
discussed in later chapters (see for instance, premixed flames, Chapter 6). Even so,
efforts to obtain an equivalent single-step reaction rate expression based on initial
reactant concentrations continue. Whereever a single-step reaction is inadequate,
successively increasing number of s are used to describe the chemical system so
that some overall predictions on ignition, flame propagation, etc. can be accurately
obtained. A great advantage now, in comparison to earlier times, is that a lot more
experimental data of a discriminatory nature are available. Further, comparisons
of simplified models can be made with the results of complex chemistry and the
limitations of simplified model obtained. Much of these are in the frontier area of
research.

5.2 Overview

Chemical reactions of importance to combustion are characterized by a strong de-
pendence on temperature. Active radicals are a central part of the description of
flames. These are generated by molecular events involving energetic collisions.
Phenomena dependent on or affected by reaction dominance like premixed gas igni-
tion and/or steady propagation call for a more detailed description of reactions to be
taken into account. For obtaining qualitative dependencies even in such cases, the
idea of a single-step overall reaction is very useful. In overall reactions, a single-
step equivalent reaction rate can be written as

d(Yi) AM) [dt = AgY [HY epte BIRT (5.8)

where the exponents n{, no and n can all be different (generally ny = no =1, n = 2).
