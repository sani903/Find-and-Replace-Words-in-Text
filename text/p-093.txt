Diffusion flames, as different from premixed flames, are those in which the fuel and
oxidizer are unmixed right up to the flame. The fuel and oxidizer diffuse and mix
at the flame. Reaction rates are much larger in comparison with diffusion rates.
Such flames are therefore diffusion limited. This is in direct contrast to what is
observed with premixed flames in which the reaction rate the most important factor
in deciding their structure. There are other differences between the behaviour of
diffusion and premixed flames which we shall examine later. It is also good to
recognize that diffusion flames occur more often in nature and that when flames/
fires are caused, nature makes sure that the fuel and oxidizer elements are separate
to increase the stability of life. When fire is caused, oxidizer, usually air, gets to the
fuel vapours at the flame resulting in a diffusion flame.

Though we wish to talk of flames, one can include vaporisation as a natural
subset of the investigation. We shall investigate three classes of flames— gaseous
burner flames, droplet combustion and boundary layer combustion.

Gaseous burner flames occur in laboratories and in nature. The bunsen burner
flame with its air vent closed, flares in petrochemical complexes and unwanted gas
duct explosions resulting in flames from underground gas jets in petroleum gas
exploration sites are some instances of gas diffusion flames. A wood crib fire is an-
other example of diffusion flame. The flow of oxidizer-rich gases past a burning fuel
