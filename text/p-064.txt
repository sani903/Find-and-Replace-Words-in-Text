ity at different points and the extent of influence of the fluctuations at one point
in its neighbourhood. At any level of intensity, if the scale of turbulence is large,
it is taken that the flame is simply contorted (or more generally called wrinkled)
and this increases the consumption rate by increasing the surface area for combus-
tion. Following this suggestion, the ratio of turbulent to laminar flame speed is
written as Sp/S,=area of wrinkled surface/area of cross section The area ratio is

calculated from geometrical considerations using some model descriptions and one
obtains Area ratio = 1 + (y/@/2/S,). Thus one obtains

Sp = Sy + Vu? (6.6)

as a result for one extreme condition. In another extreme of small scale turbulence,
the turbulence is expected to simply enhance the diffusivity of the fluid.

Su = \/ ki" Je,

St/S = v (k/ 0) Turtutent / (5p) Laminar

If we note

it is taken that

 

It also implies that the ratio of flame thicknesses of turbulent to laminar is the
same, namely

 

dr/d; = V (k/ Co) Purbutent/ (kp) Laminar (6.7)
