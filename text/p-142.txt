ahead will volatalise and thus enable ignition. This helps continued propagation of
the flame. The flame spread rate can be estimated by first writing a heat balance
equation on the surface of the sheet at the point closet to the flame (we can identify
such a location by = = 0 — see Fig. 14.1),

The left-hand side is the heat flux transferred from the flame. The right hand side
is the heat received at the surface ahead of the flame. It is obtained by multiplying
the convective flux per unit distance by the thickness of the sheet across which the
temperature is taken to be uniform.

It is important to estimate the gradients (07'/0y) and (07 /0x) at y = 0.

where Tt, T,, and Tj are the flame, surface vaporisation and ambient temperatures
respectively. The characteristic distance Ay and Ax are identified with distance for
heat to be transferred from flame to the surface and along the sheet from the flame
to the point of ignition. The characteristic physical features describing the distance
are thermal diffusivity (k,) and velocity of the in gas phase (of the local wind, say).
Thus Ay = Ax = ky/pgcpuy, Where ug, is the speed of the wind against which the
flame may be spreading. With these we get
