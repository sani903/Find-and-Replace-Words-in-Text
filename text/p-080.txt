8 Ignition

ratio, etc. Ignition in liquids is affected by the fire point of the liquid fuel, apart
from the ambient pressure and initial temperature. Ignition in gasoline engines
is spark-initiated and that in diesel engines compression-initiated. The combined
action of high temperature and pressure towards the end of the compression stroke
causes ignition of the tiny liquid droplets Injected before the end of the compression
stroke.

In rocket engines, hypergolic combinations for liquid engines eliminate the need
for separate ignition system. In other engines using non-self-igniting propellants,
an ignition system is called for. These are usually based on the same propellant
and ignition is caused in smaller chambers with spark initiation. The hot gases
then become pilot flame for the main engine ignition.

In solid rocket engines, the igniter serves the purpose of building pressure inside
the combustion chamber and also produces hot particles of metal or metal oxides
which impinge on the solid propellant and create many ignition sources for the
entire propellant to ignite in a small time.
