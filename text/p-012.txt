1 Why Should One Attempt to Understand Combustion?

It gives an insight into the way things work and hence significantly reduces the
dependence on the trial and error technique.

1.1 Overview

Fuels and oxidizers can be in gaseous, liquid, solid form. They undergo exothermic
reactions under a variety of conditions â€” from those at near ambient pressure and
those at very high pressures. They result in high temperature gases that travel at
low speeds (called deflagrations) or at very high speeds (called detonations).

The main aim of combustion is to release the energy of the fuels by reacting with
suitable oxidizers into sensible heat such that the efficiency of combustion as high
as possible (close to 100 % in many instances) and the undesirable emissions are
at a minimum. The broad spectrum of conditions under which combustion is per-
formed calls for a fundamental understanding of various effects. In this endeavour,
both fluid mechanics and chemical thermodynamics are needed. To signify this, the
field of combustion is some times referred to as aero-thermo-chemistry.

To achieve an understanding of the subject, experimental data and analytical
tools of varying complexity are needed. This book addresses the simplest of the
approaches to the understanding of the phenomena.
