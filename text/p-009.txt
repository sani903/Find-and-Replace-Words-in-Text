(Him they send, the seer, the ray of intuition, the foundation. the light on
the hill, the kingdom of peace in earth and heaven; I illumine with the
words of Indra the great and ancient laws of working of Fire who rends
the cities.)

Rig Veda

Combustion has a million years of history. In nature, fire must have been caused
due to wind-swayed dry branches of trees rubbing over one another or by lava from
an active volcano igniting wood or dry grass in its path. The primitive human
witnessing these must have felt awed by the heat and light of the fire and may have
run away from it at first and later perhaps bowed before it in respect. That is how
the fire God—“Agni Bhagavan” was born.

Combustion, to a large class of users of firewood for cooking, means putting
together solid pieces of fuel wood, igniting it with the modern equivalent of the flint
stone, the match stick. A bit of kerosene is sometimes sprinkled on the wood to
get the fire going quickly. The flame is then maintained by adding fuel pieces or
rearranging the pieces already introduced. The smoke then produced is tolerated if
the design does not have a chimney to draw away the burnt gases. More than five
hundred million homes in the world depend on solid bio-fuels for cooking.

Another class of users, largely urban, uses liquefied petroleum gas. Lighting of
a gas stove is a much simpler process; one just opens the valve in the gas stove and
uses a spark igniter or sometimes a matchstick. The spark igniter may not always
ignite the mixture if not sparked at the right time. If it sparks a little later and a
little away from the burner, a sudden large flame may result. But a steady flame is
sustained afterwards.

The use of fire is not confined to cooking alone; humans have found a plethora
of uses for it, especially after the industrial revolution. In creating new materials,
