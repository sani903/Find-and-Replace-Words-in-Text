These results when combined with the boundary condition at £ = 1 leads to

One can show from this relation that no solutions are possible for A < 1.2 or Q >
0.88 — this comes about due to the left-hand side having a minimum value because
either the numerator or the denominator will contribute to an increase in the value
of the function. This leads to Ina = 1.2 and hence the maximum temperature, Tq.

For typical values of E = 180kJ/mole, Ty = 300 K, the departure of the maximum
temperature from the ambient will be 1.6 %, which is negligible. All that this means
is that a reactive solid at an ambient temperature will remain quiet until the tem-
perature departs from its original value by only a few degrees. Beyond this change
the reaction rate rises so fast that temperature reaches runaway conditions, and
the result is an explosion.

For the case of cylindrical geometry (n = 1), the length scale L. can be inter-
preted as the radius of the explosive. In this case a transformation, y = In§, con-
verts the differential equation to

where ¢ = 60+ 2y. The solution technique is very elegant and simple and leads to the
result that explosion occurs for all A > 2. This leads to the maximum temperature
departing from the ambient by an expression similar to eqn. (17.15), but with the
constant 1.2 replaced by 1.38.

For the spherical case, analytical solutions are not possible. Numerical solutions
show that the coefficient 1.2 in Eq. (17.15) replaced by 1.6 in this case. In all the
cases, the fact that Q > Q..;; (= 0.88, 2, 3.32 for plane, cylindrical and spherical
geometries respectively) leads to explosion implies that the same material shaped
in one form or the other will explode.

It is not to be interpreted that spherical geometry is less sensitive compared to
cylindrical, since, in the case of spherical geometry the total material is bounded,
whereas in other cases the material can be semi-infinite. If one were to treat a cube
of dimension L. instead of a plane material of width L., one would get a different
