1. Liquified Petroleum Gas air Domestic purposes, furnaces
(LPG)
2. Biogas air Domestic purposes, engines
3. Producer gas air Engines (Reciprocating), fur-
naces
4. Acetylene Oxygen (O03) Gas welding/gas cutting appli-
cations
5. Basic fuel Species, Basic Oxidising all combustion
Methane, propane, Bu- Species, O; (N, is
tane, Carbon monoxide, generally an inert)
Hydrogen
II. Liquid Fuels-Oxidiser
