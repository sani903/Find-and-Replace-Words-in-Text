lations are observed. If they die down, the engine is stable. Depending on the rate
of the decay of the pressure, the stability of engine is rated.

It sounds a bit strange; we have talked so much about stability of liquid engine
but very little of solid rocket engine. Why?

The essential elements of instability discussed above do occur in solid rocket
engines also. But then the propellants usually have a high metal loading (~17%
aluminium). When these particles get into gas phase and combust, they provide
acoustic damping. The damping is to such an extent that most instabilities are
suppressed even in large engines. This does not mean, however, that instabilities
are absent in solid rocket engines; they are present, to a lesser extent and with
lesser intensity.

12.3 Hybrid Rocket Engines

Hybrid rocket engines generally use a solid polymeric fuel and a liquid oxidizer.
The feed system containing a tank, pressurisation unit, a valve and injector re-
sembles a liquid rocket engine and the combustion chamber having the fuel block
is configured like a solid rocket engine (Fig.12.6). During steady operation, com-
bustion has to proceed close to the surface in a boundary layer. The principle of
combustion in this engine is like the boundary layer combustion discussed earlier.
