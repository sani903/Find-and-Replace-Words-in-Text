This behaviour of the blow-off speed with pressure seen via pressure alone or through
Sy is indeed found experimentally appropriate. The blow-off speed peaks around
stoichiometry and falls off on either side like flame speed. It also scales like the
characteristic dimension of the obstacle. In the after-burners, the size of the V-
gutter is chosen as a compromise between flame stability and allowable pressure
drop across the after-burner caused primarily by the bluff body.

9.5 Overview

In this chapter the elements of combustion theory relevant to flame stability and
extinction/blow off have been examined. The ideas of laminar flame speed repre-
senting reactivity of fuel-oxidant mixture along with quench distance are used in
describing the stability of flames in burner. The combustion stability and blow-off
in gas turbine combustors and bluff body flame holders are described in terms of
well-stirred reactors. An alternate but entirely equivalent view in terms of time
scales invoking the first Damkohler number is shown to be very effective in ex-
tracting dependence of speed at blow off or stability limits in terms of pressure and
geometric parameters.

The extinction of diffusion/premixed flames in complex situation calls for de-
tailed calculations and plots of maximum temperature in the field with externally
induced velocity (or its inverse). Reversed S curves (or S curve) result from such
calculations and one obtains branches involving flame or no flame and transition
between them depending on the fluid speed.
