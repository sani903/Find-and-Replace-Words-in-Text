and thus the एंथलपी change of the system represents the heat transfer to the sys-
tem at constant pressure. The difference between changes in एंथलपी and internal
energy represents work done by the system. Like internal energy, एंथलपी is also
uniquely related to temperature in a perfect gas. To see this, we need to make
use of the equation of state, an equation relating pressure, density (or volume) and
temperature resulting from Boyle’s and Charle’s Laws.

p= p#T = pRT | MH (4.5)

or pv = mRT, where R is the universal gas constant and .#, the molecular weight
of the gases. This gives,
dh/dt =c, + Z = ¢ (4.6)

where c, = the constant pressure specific heat.

It is now the right time to discuss the properties of mixtures because we need
to deal with situations of a number of species being together. The fundamental
principle that applies here is the one given by Dalton who stated that in a container
having a mixture of gases the total pressure exerted by the mixture equals the sum
of the pressures of the gases which can be taken to exert pressure as though each
alone is present. Such individual pressures are called partial pressures, By the
statement of this definition, one can write

piv = mT = mu ZT | MH; 4.7)
where p; is the partial pressure of species i and m; is the mass of the species i.

If we express the total pressure by pv = m#ZT = mRT/.#, we can state the
Dalton’s Law as,
p=2Xpi (4.8)

In combustion literature, one uses molar units, one mole implying mass equiva-
lent to molecular weight. Thus we have

n; = mg) M; (4.9)
and p;v = n; RT, pv = nRT. The ratio n;/n equals X; called the mole fraction.
Xi; =n;/n=p;/p (4.10)
In addition, one defines mass fraction as
Y; =m;/m (4.11)

the ratio of the mass of the species i to the total mass.

Equations (4.10) and (4.11) concerning X; and Y; can be used to write Y; =
mg/m = (n;.M;)/(n.#) and we get

Yi = X; MM (4.12)
