to sulfur dioxide, and other inorganic matter that would end up as ash when coal
is burnt. The analysis of coal for moisture fraction, ash fraction, volatile matter
and fixed carbon are set out in Table 2.3. The content of sulfur and nitrogen (sulfur
is about 0.3 to 0.8 % of the coal) is important for emissions of sulfur dioxide and
oxides of nitrogen (see Chapter 16 on emissions from combustion systems) when
coal is burnt, generally in boilers. The exhaust gases have to be treated to ensure
compliance with emission norms of the state and the country.

Coals are burnt in furnaces fixed to boilers to generate high pressure steam
that runs turbines which run electric generators. Indian coals are characterized
by a high ash content compared to rest of the coals in the world as can be seen
from Table 2.3. Their use poses problems of ash fusion and clinkering on grate
whose resolution demands carefully thought-out solutions. Sometimes the coal is
finely powdered and the powdered coal (called pulverized coal) is burnt directly in
furnaces.

There have been attempts to produce liquid fuels from coal by the distillation
process. Though there has been some success in this effort, the process is not widely
accepted yet. There are also methods by which the coal is gasified and the gases so
obtained are cleaned and subjected to a process known as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
to get a diesel like liquid fuel.

The special fuels and oxidizers are those used largely by the aerospace industry.
Many of the special fuels like polymers have been extensively used in other areas as
well. Polymers are essentially long-chain molecules of a basic chemical unit called
monomer. All plastic materials are polymers. In fact many natural products are
also polymers. Typical molecular weights of polymers vary from 103 to 106. At
molecular weights of the order of 102, one has a very viscous liquid. At 10°, one has
a hard solid. The monomers or liquid polymers called prepolymers become large
