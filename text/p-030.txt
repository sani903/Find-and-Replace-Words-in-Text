3 Chemistry and Stoichiometry

of receiving electrons, oxygen next, chlorine, bromine and iodine follow. In the fuel
range, we have carbon, hydrogen, aluminum, magnesium, lithium, , , , , iodine,
and potassium. Thus in a compound like F503, fluorine has the oxidising capability
and oxygen acts as a fuel. Since fluorine is a very powerful oxidizer, it would re-
act quickly and form stable products. Nature therefore is bestowed with relatively
small amounts of fluorine. Oxygen, then remains the next most abundant and pow-
erful oxidizer. The power is reduced only by dilution with inert substance namely,
nitrogen. On the fuel side, the more reactive of the fuels are sodium and potassium.
Given a certain amount of oxygen, in an environment of mixture of fuel elements
like C, H, Al, or Na, it is the metal elements which get oxidized largely, then hy-
drogen and carbon elements. The most common fuels are based on hydrocarbons.
But metals are used as well to meet the requirements in special cases like in rocket
engines.

3.2 Overview

In this chapter we have seen some elementary, but important aspects of combustion
namely stoichiometry. We have also seen what fuels and oxidizers are and why
they are so. Fuels are donors of electrons and oxidizers are acceptors of electrons.
The most powerful oxidizer is fluorine; metals are very reactive fuels (though this
quality alone does not make them most eminent all the time). Stoichiometric ratio
refers to the amount of oxidizer required to completely oxidize the fuel to stable
products of combustion at ambient (or more correctly standard) conditions.

We shall now see what happens when reactions like the above take place. You
may have already concluded that heat is evolved during the reactionâ€”how much
heat and what happens to this heat and how high the gas temperature rises?
