and the experimental observation can be represented in a dimensionless manner
by stating

h _ ReSc

J 1 (10.2)

 

where Sc = pu/Di2p = v/D13 = Schmidt number is a term of the order unity (~
0.75-1.2). One would see that the expression shows no dependence on fuel prop-
erties. This is simply because we have not accounted for it yet. For the same flow
rate and diameter of the duct, if requirements of stoichiometry are higher (implying
more air is required to burn a fixed amount of fuel), then the flame height has to
be larger. Also, if the active oxidizer mass fraction in the surrounding air, Yj, is
increased, one would expect the flame height to be lower. Thus one would expect

We will present a simple argument which includes these effects and obtain the
expression for flame height.

Suppose the flame is enclosed in a cylinder of diameter d and height h. The
fuel flow rate is 7. The flame will acquire just enough air for it to burn completely.
This means that the air obtained by diffusion should be in स्टोइकोमेट्रिक proportion
with fuel flow. This means 74/1 = 1/fs. The flow rate of air is the product of
mass flux, and the area, thd. The mass flux is given by Fick’s law of diffusion as
Di2p(dYy/dx). We can take take dYy = (Yp — 0), dz = d/2 and write down the
relationship for the स्टोइकोमेट्रिक air-to-fuel flow rate as

mhd x 2D12p x Yo = Mir = 5 (10.3)

Thus,

We now have an expression that takes into account all the factors. It is also possible
to set up the problem of jet diffusion by writing down the conservation equations
and solving them to obtain h/d = ReSc/(48 fsYo~). One can see that the relationship
obtained from exact calculations confirm the results expected from simple approx-
imations. One interesting and important conclusion is that diffusion-dominated
phenomena have weak dependence on pressure; for instance, the mass burn rate
of a solid dominated by diffusion is independent of pressure. The latter conclusion
can be quickly seen if we argue that a one-dimensional solid surface (Fig. 10.1) is
