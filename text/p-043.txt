Figure 4.2: Adiabatic flame temperature determination

calculated using the scheme enunciated earlier. This composition is set in box (B).
The change in chemical एंथलपी between (A) and (B) is obtained in the manner in
which the heat of combustion is calculated. The heat of combustion is used to raise
the temperature of products from 7p to 7;. This part of rise in temperature is in
the form of sensible एंथलपी rise. If all the heat of combustion is used up to raise
the temperature to 7%, then one has obtained the adiabatic flame temperature. If
some heat is left in balance or the heat absorbed is larger than what is available for
an assumed temperature 7, keep computing the composition and checking the bal-
ance till heat balance is satisfied to the required degree of accuracy. If the reaction
is

Ya;A; — Ya, A;
then X(a,—a;)[hyi+hsi(To)—hs,i(298.16)] is the heat of combustion and Ya (h, (Tf) —
hsi(To)) is the sensible एंथलपी absorbed.

The process of computation needs iteration because a; depends on the tempera-
ture T. In case the composition is known, then 7; can be obtained in one step. We
shall take a few examples to clarify the procedure.

Reactants: Hs, Oo, (79/21)N5: initial temperature: 298.16 K; and pressure: 0.1
M Pa. The initial composition has an air-to-fuel ratio, A/F = 68.6. A/F for stoichiom-
etry is 34.3, and so this implies that the initial equivalence ratio is 0.5.

The products in this case will be HO and N, with excess oxygen remaining
unutilised. This means

Ho + Oy + 3.76 Ny — Ho0 + (1/2)09 + 3.76 Ny

and therefore, a; = 1, ap = 1, a3 = 3.76, a} =0, a}, = 1/2, a45=3.76, a), = 1.
