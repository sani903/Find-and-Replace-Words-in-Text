5 How Does a Reaction Proceed? At What
Rate?

We saw till now what reaction products are and how to compute their mass or mole
fractions in the mixture. The question we ask now is how fast is an equilibrium
state attained from a given initial state. In order to compute this we should describe
the rate of generation or destruction of a given species in a reaction system. It may
be recalled that a hydrogen—oxygen reaction was set out as

H2 + (1/2)O2 + pNy — H20 + pNo

Does the reaction proceed this way? If the products contain many species like we
found in equilibrium products, will the reaction proceed differently?

The reaction does not proceed in the way indicated by simple stoichiometry. This
is not due to the fact that equilibrium products contain many other species, for one
can consider cases of low flame temperature with a larger inert fraction and make
sure that no species other than the only stable product are present in any significant
measure. Yet the reaction does not proceed along the path shown. Why is this so?

To answer this we must understand as to how a reaction takes place. In a
gaseous medium it is known that molecules are moving randomly with a range of
velocities with a mean related to the temperature of the gas. Collisions occur during
the random movements of molecules. These collisions are usually unproductive,
i.e. the molecules after collision move away in different directions without any
change in the molecular structure. Amongst these collisions, some occur at higher
velocities. At these velocities the molecules act like bullets and when they collide,
they end up breaking up molecules or forming bonds with other molecules. For
instance, consider the following reactions:

H2 + H2 — H+ H+ H2 (1)
H2 +0; — H+H+02 (2)
H2+M—H+H+M (3)

HO+0O —0:+H (4)

H+O+M—OH+M (5)

In the first reaction, Hs collides with another H, and breaks up to form Hydrogen
atoms. Here only one bond is broken. In reaction (2), the collision of Hs occurs
