oxide particles. The rapid generation of gases causes a rise in pressure and the
hot particles cause local ignition. The gases when passing through the duct along
the grain, cause convective heat transfer and thus enhance the possibility of local
ignition. The flame then begins to spread across the entire surface of the propellant
and steady operating conditions are achieved in about 0.3â€”2.5 s depending on the
size of the rocket being tested.

In large-sized rockets like PSLV stage rocket of India, the igniter constitutes a
rocket by itself. Such igniters are called pyrogen igniters. In all such cases a part
of igniter products, namely gas, is expected to raise the pressure in the chamber
and another to cause local ignition. Careful design is called for to make sure that
there are no over pressures during ignition and the transient blends smoothly into
normal, steady operating conditions.

8.6 Overview

Ignition is the first part of any combustion process. It is affected by the pressure and
the initial temperature of the system under consideration. Ignition delay, i.e., the
time from start of the ignition process to achieving steady state should be small in
systems for ignition process to be effective. The process of ignition is more difficult
at low pressures and temperatures. In gas-phase fuel-oxidant mixtures, ignition
energy is typically 0.1-0.2 mJ under quiescent conditions. In flowing mixtures,
the ignition energy increases a hundred-fold depending on velocities, local mixture
