diffusion dominated in regression (the term used for linear burn down of a surface);
we can strike an energy balance (of fluxes) at the surface and write
T
k ES ={" = pprL
dy y=0
where p,r is the product of the density of solid and solid regression rate and L, the
heat of phase change from solid to gas and ¢”, the heat flux expressed in terms of
Fourier’s law of conduction. Noting that dy can be replaced by a quantity propor-

tional to h and dT replaced by the difference between an effective flame temperature
and surface temperature, one can write k(7y — T)/h = p,7L. So one gets

pu = (Ty — Ty) /hL

Noting that rn; = p,7(7/4)d*> where d the particle size, we can express the earlier
equation for h as

If we use this expression in the expression for burn rate we get

Since h is independent of pressure, it follows that p,r, the mass burning rate (or
mass flux) as it is called, is independent of pressure as is evident from the above
equation. An additional result that can be obtained from this equation is taht the
burn rate increases with decrease in particle size. This result is applicable till a
point when premixedness takes over (that happens below a particle size).
