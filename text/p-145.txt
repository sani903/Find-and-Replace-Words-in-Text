by fire. While the development of fire science is complicated due to a whole variety of
factors involved, the understanding obtained through it helps in better judgement
and planning of strategies for fire fighting.

14.3 Overview

This chapter discussed briefly the mechanics of fire spread and fire prevention.
Simple theoretical models are possible for predicting fire spread rate on thin and
thick sheets, in horizontal or vertical modes, with or without wind. More is possible
in terms of predictions for larger fires where radiation is important (not discussed
here).

Fire prevention methods, while involving common sense concepts of keeping fuel
away from oxidant or not having fire or ignition sources close to fuels and so on, also
involve the design of materials less inflammable and chemicals which discourage
specific fire types.

The last two decades have led to considerable understanding of the mechanisms
of fire spread and prevention, driven as it were by the need to transport large num-
ber of special chemicals in large quantities by rail or road. some of these having led
to serious disasters.
