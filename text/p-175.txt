like HTPB and the class of explosives PBXN refer to plastic bonded explosives.
These have been produced to be safe for storage and handling and would function
with the right detonating input. There are many more compositions like the ones
in table 17.2 developed for specific missiles and applications including underwater
warheads. For instance, PBXN-101 is used in a strike missile and PBXN-103 in
Mk 46 Torpedo.

When shock waves move through fluids/condensed phase of different densities,
the interface effects due to differing densities will be felt. A shock wave in air hitting
a solid surface will get reflected as a shock; it also passes into the solid medium as
shock. If the shock wave in a solid medium hits the surface beyond which is air, say,
then the shock wave gets reflected as an expansion wave and transmits the shock
wave into the atmosphere. It is the behaviour of the shock reflecting as an expansion
wave that causes the breaking up of brittle materials like rock which can withstand
very little tensile loads.

An interesting feature in Table 17.2 is the occurrence of TNT in many composi-
tions even though it is a low-performing explosive. The reason for this is that it can
be melted at 80 °C, a value that is far from the decomposition temperature of 250—
300 °C, and hence one can integrate other compounds into it to produce explosives
of desired detonating property. One useful and interesting property of detonation
of mixtures is that the mixture detonation speed is a weighted mean of those of the
components.

The detonation properties described in Table 17.1 are dependent on the density
of the substance. It is possible to reduce the density of packing crystals and powders
in containers to lower levels. In doing so, the detonation velocity will be lowered
linearly generally. Typically, a reduction in the density of RDX from 1800 to 800
kg/m? through packing arrangements leads to reduction of detonation speed from
8.9 to 5.5 km/s.

There are many substances that deflagrate easily but do not detonate. There
