case A that a flame over the tube is possible and in the other two cases flame will
either blow off or simply flash back. Thus for (du/dy) such that

(du/dy)iow < (du/dy) < (du/dy)nign

the flame is stable. Experiments seem to confirm this behaviour as shown in
Fig. 9.3. One can now understand why flames in burners flash back or blow off
when fuel is changed. If one changes LPG to acetylene, S, goes up at the same flow
rate and the flame will move towards flash-back. On the other hand, if one moves
from acetylene to LPG, the tendency of the flame will be to blow off. One can change
this behaviour by effecting a change in velocity profile near the rim. For instance,
providing a reduced section near the exit as shown in Fig. 9.4 causes a reverse flow
and the classical flow structure is destroyed. This enhances the flame stability.

9.2 Stability of Flames in Gas Turbine Combustors

We now move on to case (b) of Fig. 9.1. In this case we have to determine the
range of velocities and pressures over which flame can exist inside the system. The
flow rates are so large that the flow is turbulent. Air is injected partly axially
and partly through the holes shown. The arrangement of holes regulates the fuel-
air mixture to near स्टोइकोमेट्रिक near the fuel injection zone and leaner toward
the exit. Mixing is intense in the first zone close to fuel injection. This region is
called the primary zone. The combustion in this zone is likened to what is known
as well-stirred reactor. A stirred reactor is one in which fuel-oxidizer elements
are taken as completely mixed and the phenomenon is dominated by the reaction
processes alone. At steady state, the reactants flow in at rn (mass flow rate), react

at a volumetric rate of wf with heat of combustion H and raise their temperature
