15.2 Overview

Updraft gasifier is tolerant to the variation in fuel quality, but generates a com-
bustible gas with high levels of tar. It is usually used for raising steam or other
thermal applications. Fluid bed gasification system also generates a gas with sub-
stantial amounts of tar. Downdraft gasifiers, on the other hand, provide good per-
formance including very low levels of tar, but the feed stock must be better prepared
in terms of size and with minimum moisture (sundry condition usually implies 8 to
12 % moisture). This burden on fuel preparation for use in downdraft gasifiers pays
off by little additional maintenance on end-use devices like engines. Fixed bed sys-
tems respond to change on demand at the downstream end (through the opening
of a valve in the pipe carrying the gas, say) without any additional action. Fluid
bed systems, however, need to control the fuel feed and air flow rates as soon as the
change in demand is sensed.
