Consider the following reactions.
CHy +209 — CO2 + 2H50
CO + (1/2)05 — CO,
H2 + (1/2)0Oy — H50
C(s) + (1/2)02 — CO4

In which of the above reactions can we talk of heat of formation? Since the
heat of formation refers to a species, the first reaction (A) cannot qualify for con-
sideration at all. In (B), the component elements are CO and O, and these are not
the reactants. Hence (B) does not qualify either. (C) and (D) reactions do qualify
for consideration of heats of formation. The heats of reaction here give the heat
of formation of H>O and CO,. For others, the table is formed from the measure-
ments of heat of combustion/reaction in various reactions. For example, Ho, O2, No,
Fy, Clo, Bry, C(s), Mg, Al, B, are all taken to have zero heat of formation. The
heat of formation of H, O, OH, H>O, N, F»O3, HCl, HBr ...are all obtained from
experimental data and by imposing conditions of self-consistency.

In a sense, the idea of heat of formation is no different from that of heat of
combustion, which an engineer is most familiar with. Heat of combustion refers to
a reaction while heat of formation refers to a species. The latter can be seen to be a
great advantage since the same species can be involved in several kinds of reactions
and one needs to keep track only of heat of formation of each of the species and not
heats of reaction of several hundred combinations. Table 4.1 shows the values of
heats of formation (h;) of some of the important species. While Tables 4.2, 4.3, and
4.4 show the specific heats, sensible enthalpies and other properties of relevance to
combustion. How do we use it to get the heat of combustion?
