(k = thermal conductivity of the gas). An overall heat balance leads to H ~ ¢, (Ty —

Tp). If we use this we get,

k
Wd; = — (6.2)
C

Another relationship is obtained if we recognize p,S, = wd 7 (=mass flux of mix-
ture). Hence

dy = (k/ep) x (1/puSa) (6.3)

and
puSu = / (k/cp)wf (6.4)

These are the two major results. The flame thickness is inversely proportional to
flame speed. Experimental results confirm this as already indicated. The flame
speed varies as the square root of reaction rate. The reaction rate in the above ex-
pression should be treated as an average value, The expression indicates that flame
speed is representative of the reaction rate of premixed mixture. If we now recall
the results of flame speed indicated earlier, we conclude that Ho—O, स्टोइकोमेट्रिक
mixture is lot more reactive compared to H2—air which itself is more reactive com-

pared to LPG-air system. If we introduce the structure of wy averaged in some
sense, we write

RT; _ 1
S., ~ (feo) Ap =p" E/2RTy ~ p(n/2) le E/RTy (6.5)

where n is the overall order of reaction, 7 the adiabatic flame temperature.

If most reactions are taken as bimolecular, n ~ 2, then S, ~ p°, i.e., 9, is in-
dependent of pressure. If n ~ 2.4 say, S, ~ p°2, and if n ~ 1.8, S, ~ p*!. Thus
the pressure index of S, varies from —0.1 to 0.2 for this range of overall orders of
reaction (1.8 to 2.4) which is usual for most systems. This result is in complete con-
formity with experimental observations. The dependence on initial temperature is
caused through the change in flame temperature.
