7.2 Overview

In this chapter, we looked at flammable mixtures and quenchable regions of flames.
The two are connected with flame speeds as is amply clear from the simple ex-
pressions on quench distance and the other aspects of discussion. Understanding
these would help bring a mixture to the ignition range or take it out of it, to permit
transmission of ignition from one region to another, or prevent it.

We now move on to ignition and stability of flames.
