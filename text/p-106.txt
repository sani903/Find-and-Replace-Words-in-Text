where B = ¢,(Ty — T)/L represents the transfer number discussed earlier. The
heat transfer coefficient is expressed in terms of a non-dimensional number called
Nusselt number defined by h, = Nuk,/x, where x is the characteristic length scale.
In the case of a flat plate, vertical or horizontal, it implies the distance from the
leading edge. In the case of a cylinder or sphere, it could refer to its diameter. Thus,

In order to account for the blocking effect, the Nusselt number is first evaluated

without blocking effect and then corrected for this effect through the ratio (Nu/Nuy).
We therefore get

Non-dimensionalizing both sides by dividing by (pV), the free stream mass flux,
we get
