4.2 How Do We Compute the Composition?

till a minimum is attained. At this stage the Gibbs free energy of the reactants will
equal those of products.

IGreactants = products

Thus for reaction
Ya; A; — Ya, A;

at equilibrium,
Ya; gi = Ya, gi

Using the relationship for g; noted earlier, we get
Y(a; — aj)g; = X(a; — a;)RT np;
This can be recast as

Tp “~") = exp(~Ag°/RT), Ag° = S(a] — a;)g}

i
The notation II implies the product of all the subscripted variables.

The right-hand side is a function of temperature alone because Ag° is a function
of temperature alone. This quantity is called equilibrium constant (X,). Thus,
K,(T) = Tip (4.22)

represents the relationship used for calculating equilibrium composition, given the
temperature 1" and the pressure p.

4.2 How Do We Compute the Composition?

Given:
Reactants: moles of various species; pressure p; temperature T (example H,, 1/2
Os, No, etc.).

The process of reaction causes change of species without loss of elements. For
instance, while the final products may be HO, HO, Ho, H, Os, O in different pro-
portions, the total amount of H atoms has to be the same as initially introduced.
This represents mass conservation relation of element H. In addition, the various
species keep reacting with each other so that the net rate of production/destruction
is zero, which gives rise to equilibrium relations. To calculate the composition, one
must enunciate the possible products. In the case of H2—Os—N> reaction at high
temperatures, one may have Ho, H, Hs, O, HO, HO, No, N, NO, NoO, HNO (11
species) as possible products. The number of elements is three. The difference 11-3
(No. of species — No. of elements)=8 is the number of equilibrium relations needed
to complete the set of equations. After finding that some of the species have very
