tremely tiny orifices so that the liquid is atomised to very fine droplets as early in
its path as possible. The droplets ignite by themselves because the surrounding
air is hot ~ 500-600 K. The droplets burn up raising the pressure in the chamber
(which peaks slightly after the piston crosses the top dead centre), and the expan-
sion process extracts the energy released. The whole process takes place under
highly transient conditions. The time available for combustion is about 4-5 ms for
a 1500 rpm four-stroke engine. Higher speed engines permit even lesser time for
combustion.

The mechanics of combustion is slightly different in the case of spark ignition
engines. The carburettor mixes the fuel in the form of vapour or very fine droplets
with air and this is inducted into the combustion chamber. After it is inducted,
the spark is fired causing ignition. During this process, the gas is also being com-
pressed. After ignition, the flame travels and consumes the entire reactant mixture.
Again the peak pressure is attained after the piston recedes from the top dead cen-
tre. Many two-wheelers have two-stroke spark ignition engines. These engines,
because they have to be compact, run at high speeds, as much as 4500-5000 rpm.
The time available for combustion in such cases is about 2-3 ms. That is why, the
pollutant emission per unit power of such engines is higher as compared to that in
four stroke engines.

13.4 Overview

This chapter has considered the application of combustion in devices. Stoves are
burners which burn gas, liquid fuel or solid fuel with natural draft, as convention-
ally understood. Use of forced draft helps improve the combustion process, with the
possibility of outstanding efficiency and emission performance. Industrial devices
