4 How Much Heat? How High a Temperature?

Heat of combustion = 242 kJ. This heat is absorbed by the products as

(hs, 1,0(Ts) — his, 1,0(298.16)] + (1/2) [hs,0, (Ty) — hs,0,(298.16)]
+3.76[hs nv, (Ty) — hsv, (298.16)] = 242.0 k.J

If we take an approximate constant value for ¢, in a temperature range of 1000—
2000 K as 45, 32 and 34 kJ/mole K for HO, O2 and H, respectively, we can write
the above equation as

(45 + (1/2) x 32 + 3.76 x 34) (Tf — 298.16) = 242.0 k.J
Tj — 298.16 = (242.0 x 10%)/189.0 = 1250 K

Therefore 7; = 1548 K. This value is about as accurate as can be obtained from
detailed calculations. If there were no nitrogen in the initial mixture, one would
get

(40 + 1/2 x 40)(Tf — 298.16) = 242.0 k.J
Ty — 298.16 = 242000/60 = 4330 K, Ty ~ 4630 K.

At this temperature, the product H>O will not remain undissociated. Therefore a
fair amount of एंथलपी will be absorbed in dissociation. The products contain H5O,
Oo, OH, O, H, etc. and the process of creating the elements and radicals makes
lesser amount of एंथलपी available for raising the temperature. This makes the
temperature to be about 2600 K or so.

One can make detailed calculations (given the initial data) using the NASA
programme referred to earlier. This programme is so powerful that in most cases
one can obtain a result in less than a few seconds of computational time on any
modern personal computer.

Till now, discussions were concentrated on reactions at constant pressure be-
cause in several practical situations like in rocket engines or diesel combustion,
combustion occurs at constant pressure. There may be situations where combustion
occurs at constant volume. In such cases the quantity to be used for minimization
is Helmholtz free energy function = e¢ — T's. Using the procedure already illus-
trated, but replacing Gibbs free energy function by Helmholtz free energy function,
one obtains the composition and flame temperature. at constant volume conditions.
Generally, these values will be larger than those corresponding to constant pres-
sure by 100-200 K because there is no work output in a constant volume reaction.
We shall take a look at some results.

Table 4.7 shows the results of flame temperature and product composition for
kerosene—air system for various air-to-fuel ratios. The स्टोइकोमेट्रिक ratio is about
15. The flame temperature peaks around this value and drops on either side. The
products at this condition contain about 1.2% (vol) of carbon monoxide. If we use
