13.4 Overview

like burners have to burn at high flow rates of fuel (and so high power) and employ
forced draft fan which k the pressure inside the system higher than the ambient or
use an induced draft fan which draws the air through the combustion device so that
the pressure inside the combustion unit is below the ambient. Combustion is also
carried out at higher pressures 2 to 20 atm so that the device can be made more
compact. This is because higher pressures imply higher volumetric reaction rates
(~ p?) so that the volume of the chambers for burning up at the same fuel flow rates

can be reduced approximately as p—2.

Swirl is another artifice for reducing the length of the combustion chambers.
Swirling the flow implies causing tangential entry of the fluid into a cylindrical
chamber. This reduces the axial length of the chamber even though the path length
for combustion remains the same. Most combustion devices use it to great advan-
tage.

The turn-down ratio is typically about 4 for many combustion devices—stoves,
burners and gas turbine combustion chambers.

The knowledge of the combustion processes in high thrust/power gas turbine
engines has led to benefits in terms of reducing the combustor size and therefore,
its weight to almost half in about a decade and a half.

The combustion chambers of reciprocating engines have also undergone a sea
change in the last three decades through the use of high pressure turbo-superchargers
and electronics for sensing and controllling the combustion parameters.
