Figure 12.3: Particle Size Effect

at low pressure and diffusion flame effects at high pressure lead to an average de-
pendence of burn rate on pressure like p,i ~ ap??~%* as observed experimentally.
One can similarly argue the effect of particle size on the burn rate. If one conceives
of large particle sizes, then the same oxidizer is to be shared by the binder with
these particles in comparison to the larger number of smaller particles being made
available to the binder otherwise during combustion. This causes a better flame
temperature distribution over the surface and the flame moves closer to the surface
(Fig. 12.3). Consequently, the heat transfer back to the condensed phase is higher

and so the burn rate is higher, too.

Burn rate control is an important aspect of propellant design. Increase of burn
rates in double-base propellants is obtained by adding metal powders of cobalt,
copper, silver etc. Decrease of burn rates can be effected by the addition of lead and
lead salts. The burn rate index can be brought to zero over some range of pressures
by using lead salts.

In the case of composite propellants, copper chromite (CuCr204) and Iron ox-
ide (F'e203) are known to enhance the burn rates significantly. Lithium oxide and
lithium fluoride cause reduction in burn rates, and in some cases reduction of burn
rate index as well.
