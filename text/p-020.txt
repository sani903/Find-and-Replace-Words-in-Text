Figure 2.3: Composition of Biomass on an moisture-free, ash-free basis

Coal is the largest and most widespread fossil fuel resource providing 70% of
India’s energy and 23% of World’s energy. It will remain as a fuel of relevance for
a long time even though widespread concerns about ebvironmental emissions have
begun to limit the growth of its use. Coal is produced by natural processes over
geological times when biomass was crushed under a load of overburden created by
volcanoes and other natural disasters. This process reduces the volatile content in
biomass and what is left in coal is much lower as can be noted from Table 2.3. Coal is
classified by a term known as rank, which is a measure of the alteration the coal has
undergone during its formation. The consecutive stages in the evolution of the coal
from biomass are: peat, lignite (brown coal), sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal,
and anthracite in the increasing order of the rank or the extent of carbonization.
Sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite are together called black coal
or hard coal. Lignite (or brown coal) is relatively soft with a heating value of only
about a quarter of that of black coal. Coal is very dense as much as twice to thrice
that of biomass because it is formed under highly stressed conditions. Interlayered
with other inorganic matter, coal beds form up to many meters in thickness and
these are known as seams. It is mined from open mines or from deep underground.

Coal varies widely in its composition. It is composed chiefly of rings of six car-
bon atoms joined together in an extremely complex composition of layered arrange-
ments that have not only hydrogen but significant amounts of oxygen and nitrogen.
The structure also includes varying amounts of sulfur which on combustion leads
