Figure 2.2: Boiling and freezing range vs Density of petroleum based liquid fuels

chain compounds (like the family of methane, ethane, propane, etc.) and aromat-
ics (like benzene, toluene etc.). Figure 2.2 shows the boiling ranges and densities
of these fuels. One can see clearly that gasolines vaporise better than kerosenes,
a fact which is easily known because, one can smell gasoline more than kerosene
under ambient conditions. One may wonder what smelling has to do with boiling
point. If something does not vaporise easily, its molecules are not found in the at-
mosphere and cannot be smelt. The fact that you cannot smell diesel as easily as
gasoline implies that gasoline vaporises better than diesel.

Kerosenes come in a wide range. They include those used at home as well as
those meant for the gas turbines of aircraft, called aviation turbine fuel (ATF). The
ATF is a refined kerosene, obtained by particularly eliminating Sulphur so that
the life of turbine blades (which experience the combusted hot gases of fuel — air
mixture) is extended.

Gasoline is most extensively used in reciprocating spark ignition (SI) engines.
They vaporise easily and are mixed with air in right proportions before their entry
into the combustion chamber.

Diesel fuels are used in compression ignition (CI) engines where no spark is
needed to intitiate the combustion process. These engines work at much higher
compression ratio than gasoline engines. The fuel is injected in the form of spray
into hot compressed air. The fuel ignites and combustion follows.
