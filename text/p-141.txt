(He is the close comrade of the Rivers as is a brother of his sisters. He
devours the earth’s forests as a king his enemies. When driven by the
breath of the wind he ranges around the forests, the Flame tears asunder
the hairs of Earth’s body.)

Rig Veda

Let us take a few instances of fire in our environment.

(a) Suppose there is a fire involving furniture, like tables, chairs that are made
of wood in various shapes and sizes arranged at a residence. Can it be estimated
how much time is available before the fire can be controlled?

(b) A large grassland with a dry stack catches fire at one end. Would this lead to
a total loss of the material? At what rate would it propagate? How can one combat
the fire?

(c) Most of the present day clothing is made of synthetic fibres like nylon and
polyester which are prone to fire hazard to an extent greater than cotton. Can the
clothing be made fire resistant?

These are questions that need careful analysis on the basis of principles dis-
cussed till now.

14.1 Fire spread rates on thin and thick sheets

Let us consider a thin sheet of paper in horizontal position being ignited at one end.
It is known that flame will propagate at an uniform rate called flame spread rate.
The mechanics of flame spreading is as follows (Fig. 14.1).

The flame transfers heat to the surface of the sheet by conduction and/or radi-
ation. The heat has to be transferred ahead by conduction so that some regions
