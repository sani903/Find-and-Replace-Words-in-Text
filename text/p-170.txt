16 Emissions from Combustion Systems

Emission reduction procedures are developed by understanding the way in which
emissions are generated. Combating the emissions in ground-based systems like
combustion systems for boilers and other chemical processes can be accomplished
with relatively greater ease. Providing larger residence time, better mixing and
specific inorganic treatment procedures help to reduce the emissions. Reciprocat-
ing engines and gas turbines for transport applications have to be more compact
devices and hence call for greater ingenuity in reducing the pollutants. The fuel
itself has to be cleaned up before use in these engines - sulphur isa major element
that is reduced substantially by chemical processing before the fuel is considered
acceptable. In addition, spark ignition engines use catalysts to reduce the other pol-
lutants. Compression ignition engines need to evolve in-cylinder handling of fuel
through better atomization to reduce the emissions. In recent times, diesel engines
have begun adopting exhaust treatment before being released into the atmosphere.
Filtration of particles less than 10 micrometers is one such treatment.

Several more and more stringent standards are being set to reduce the emis-
sions from stationary sources, vehicles on the road and in the atmosphere. These
call for intelligent ways for fuel processing and design of combustion systems.
