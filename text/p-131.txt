value (2.2 to 2.3 kWth). In contrast, the problem of smoking discussed earlier
is important (for wood stove) at lower power levels, typically one quarter of
nominal power (0.5 kWth). Thus the range of operation of a stove is 0.5-2.2
kWth bounded by smoking and sooting tendencies respectively. This range is
expressed by the turn down ratio, it being the rate of peak-to-minimum power
levels (4.4 in this case).

One of the problems in designing fuel-wood stoves is that the feed stock does
not have fixed geometric and physical properties. The same stove may burn at
a time 10 logs of 10 mm dia at a time or 2 logs of 30 mm dia. In the latter case,
the fuel flow rate is 40% lower. This gives less power. On the other hand, if
one has packed 30 pieces of 5 mm dia during combustion, one would have 50 %
higher power. When using a wood stove, the user cannot be expected to keep
track of surface area permitted for combustion (!) and therefore, a minimum
level of sooting and possibly smoking as well is to be expected. These issues
are taken care in gasification-based stoves discussed subsequently.

Let us look at the question of stability. Anybody who has worked with wood
stoves would know that once in a while, a well-mixed non-sooty flame is ob-
tained a little (or much) above the wood pieces, whereas over a large part of
