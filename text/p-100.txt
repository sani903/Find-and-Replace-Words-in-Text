10 Diffusion Flames

Equation (10.10) indicates that the mass vaporisation rate is proportional to the
drop radius. The dependence on transfer number is weak since the logarithmic
term changes little for large variations of B,. Let us consider a numerical example.
For rs =1 mm, k, = 0.02 W/mK, c, = 1.0 kJ/kgK, p; = 800 kg/m3, Ty = 800 K, T,=
300 K, L =300 kJ/kg,

mm =3.0x 107%, kg/s = 3.0 x 1077 kg/s = 0.30 mg/s

It may be difficult to see what this means because the initial mass of the droplet
is about 3.36 mg. You may be tempted to say it takes a time of 3.36/0.3 = 11.2
s for the drop to burn. This is not true because drop radius will keep decreasing
with time and mass burn rate also k decreasing. How then can we estimate the
burn time of a drop, a more perceivable quantity? In order to do this eqn. (10.10) is
written as 1 = dm/dt where m is the mass of the drop = (4/3)7r3p;, where p; is the
density of the liquid. If we note,

dm 9dr dr?
dat == (4/3) X pr X 3s == 2s

we can therefore write

Equation (10.13) is classically expressed in terms of diameter of droplet like

d? = d% — Kt (10.14)

where K, = 4K, , dy = Initial diameter Equation (10.14) is called the d*-law and
K, is the evaporation constant. We can obtain the drop evaporation time by setting
ds = 0 in eqn. (10.14) as

ty, = d%/K, = 1% K, (10.15)

This is an important relation showing the drop evaporation time varying as the
square of drop diameter. We can estimate the value of ¢, for the example indicated
earlier,
