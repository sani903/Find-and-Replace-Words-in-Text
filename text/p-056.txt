Thus, a 10% change in temperature more than doubles the reaction rate. This
steep dependence of reaction rate on temperature causes the study of combustion
very intriguing and interesting.

The reaction rate increases at a fast rate with temperature. But in a premixed
gas, as the temperature increases, the reactants are consumed and the rate has to
decrease beyond some temperature and go to zero eventually when the reactants
are totally consumed. Thus. the plot of the reaction rate with temperature will
show a peak, the temperature at which peak occurs being related to activation
energy (overall).

Till now we have discussed the essentials of reaction paths and reaction rates
of elementary s or molecular events. It has been brought out that single overall s
written down are good enough for स्टोइकोमेट्रिक calculations although they do not
indeed take place that way. This implies that one cannot write down strictly an
overall expression for the reaction rate. While this is indeed valid, engineering sci-
ence does not get limited by such ‘pure’ thoughts. An engineering mathematician
models reactions by a single step, assigns a rate equation with some parameters
and conducts analysis and obtains general results. He does this because the treat-
ment of complex kinetics is indeed very formidable. A typical way of expressing
overall reaction is

where ni, no, and E are constants estimated from experiments. Typically n is 1.8
to 2.2 in most cases. Till the seventies, ninety per cent of the flame problems
were treated based on single-step reaction assumption. It is only in the last two
decades that complex kinetics has been treated using better numerical techniques
and faster computers. A further factor is related to values of activation energy and
pre-exponential factor (like Ay in the Eqn. (5.8), it was a common joke that these
