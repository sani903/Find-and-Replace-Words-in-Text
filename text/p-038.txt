4 How Much Heat? How High a Temperature?

The heat of combustion per kg of fuel will be (803.5/16)M J = 50.2 M J/kg. For
reaction (C), the value of H,. at 298.16 K is 242 — 0 — 0 = 242 kJ and for H, it
will be 242/2M J = 121 M J/kg. If, in reaction (C) or any of the other reactions for
that matter one adds an inert substance like nitrogen, the heat of combustion is not
affected. It is true that this heat is now absorbed by a mass augmented by inerts
and hence one can expect the final temperature to be lower. The heat released
however, will remain the same. Table 4.5 lists the heats of combustion for some
reactions.

4.1 The Second Law

The second law states a principle indicating directions of processes. For instance,
heat flows from high temperature to low temperature. The reverse does not happen
unaided. This part of the observation is not indicated in the first law. The first law
states that either of the processes can take place provided energy is conserved.

The second law is variously understood and discussed. The useful view point
here concerns the feature indicated above. Is there a quantity which is related to
state variables (T', h, e ...) such that on an evaluation, one can state which direction
a process proceeds?

The answer lies in the statement that there is a quantity called entropy defined
by

ds = (dq) rev /T (4.20)

so that if ds is positive (for isolated systems), the process is natural and proceeds
along ds > 0. If ds < 0 in an isolated system, the system is not natural and will not
