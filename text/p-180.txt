p = pRT (equation of state) (17.4)

The quantity mn” is the mass flux through the wave. The एंथलपी difference (h1— hs)
is the heat released by the chemical reaction, Ah,. The equation of state is still
the ideal equation of state since the temperatures downstream of the shock are
sufficiently high (5000 K) even though pressures are high (about 10 to 15 M Pa). We
use a simple treatment of the equations by transforming them into Mach numbers
and requiring that M; = 1 to obtain the detonation velocity. We take note that a;
= /YRT;, where qa; is the acoustic speed (i= 1, 2) and + is the ratio of specific heats
at constant pressure to that at constant volume. We also treat h; = ¢, 7; where ¢, is
the constant pressure specific heat taken as the same for both i = 1, 2. The mass,
momentum and energy equations transform to

As can be seen, the detonation velocity is a direct function of the heat released in the
combustion process. One of the principal approximations is that the specific heats
are constant and the same; however, they depend strongly on the composition that
itself depends on the calculated temperature under burnt conditions. Thus if one
adopts an iterative procedure, with the calculation of the composition depending on
the procedure discussed in Chapter 4, one can get better estimate of the detonation
Mach number and the detonation velocity. Such a calculation demonstrates that
the results of calculation are close to experimental values.
