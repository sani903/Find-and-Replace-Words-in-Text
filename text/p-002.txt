Preface

for original papers is provided at the end. Use of internet can greatly enhance the
information base.

The present effort at the update is due to prodding by Dr. C. S. Bhaskar Dixit,
my former student to produce this edition. Not only did he persuade, he has put
in effort in getting it to this shape in many ways. Mrs. Uma Dixit has created the
figures into a new format. Mrs. Neesa Sharma converted the original book into a
soft copy for setting out modifications and additions.
