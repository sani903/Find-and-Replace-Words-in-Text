speed occurs near stoichiometry in most cases on the fuel-rich side (for e.r.~ 1.1 or
80). In the case of Ho—air and C'O-air, the peak flame speed occurs at tremendously
fuel-rich mixture (e.r.~ 1.7). The flame thickness varies from 0.2 mm to as much as
10 mm; faster flames being thinner. Figure 6.2 shows a plot of flame speeds with
mixture ratio for a few gaseous mixtures. The flame speeds depend only to a little
extent on pressure. If the flame speed, S, varies with pressure, p as S, ~ p™, m
varies from -0.3 to +0.3 depending on the chemical system and equivalence ratio of
the mixture. But the flame speed depends strongly on the initial temperature.

6.2 Why are we interested so much in Flame Speeds?

Before we answer this question, we shall examine the dependence of the flame
speed on various parameters through a simple analysis. If wy is the reaction rate

(kg/m3s) of the fuel and H the heat of combustion, then H w''dy represents the heat
flux (W/m?) caused by chemical reaction (if it is multiplied by unit cross section,
then one gets the heat generated in kW). The heat flux so obtained causes the gra-
dient between 7, the adiabatic flame temperature, and 7} the initial temperature

over the flame thickness d;. Thus,
