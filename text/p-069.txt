is called the quenching diameter and half of it is called quenching distance. Why
does a quenching distance exist at all?

The answer lies in the fact that the heat production or release rate of the flame
is not adequate enough to overcome the heat losses and propagate. Another way
of stating this result is that the flame speed k decreasing from adiabatic value to
lower values depending on the extent of heat loss and it becomes zero when heat
loss rate is a significant fraction of the heat generation rate.

The heat generation rate is calculated by multiplying the volumetric reaction
rate by the heat of combustion and volume of combustion zone given by the cross
sectional area of the duct and flame thickness. Therefore

Heat generation rate = H wf’ (mddy/4) (7.1)

Heat loss can occur by conduction or by radiation. For propagation through
tubes, which is being considered at present, it is the loss by conduction to the walls
that matters. This heat loss is estimated by stating
K(T; — Tp)

(d/2)
If heat generation rate is comparable to heat loss rate, then quenching may be
considered to occur (d = d, is the quench diameter).
