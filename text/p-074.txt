energy will simply be diffused away or lost by conduction through the surrounding
medium. The energy of the flame is the product of the sensible एंथलपी per unit
mass of the gas taken from the ambient to the flame temperature and the mass of
the gas confined within the quench diameter and flame thickness. As long as the
ignition energy (I.F) is larger than this value, ignition will take place.

LE = ¢)(Ty — To) (nd; /4)d pu) (8.1)

This states that the ignition energy is equal to the product of the sensible एंथलपी
per unit mass multiplied by the mass of the gas. If we note that d, ~ 10d; from
Eq.(7.3) we get

I.E = 100pucy(Ty — To)d} (8.2)

This expression correctly describes the qualitative behaviour of ignition energy with
pressure and initial temperature through p, and d;. Again, recalling the relation-
ship between d; and the flame speed (Eq. 6.3), we get an alternate expression for
ignition energy as,

E3 (Try — T, Tr —T,
(Ty — To) — 10002" r — To)

I.E =100
E0253 5

where «a, = gas thermal diffusivity = (k/pucp)g

If we set S, ~ p"/?>7!, p, ~ p' and k/c, as independent of pressure for a perfect
gas, LE. ~ p~2 if n=2.

Thus as pressure decreases the ignition energy becomes larger by a factor p—2.

This is a steep dependence on pressure. Let us look at some typical values for vapors
of kerosene or natural gas in air — k = 0.04W/mK, Ty —T, = 2000 K, ¢, = 1.3kJ /kgK,
S. = 0.4m/s, p, ~ 1.2kg/m3. These values lead to an ignition energy of 0.11 m.J.
This value is in the right range of values determined experimentally, noting that
this is an upper estimate of the limit. Some of these values are shown in Table 8.1.
Note that these values are for a quiescent atmosphere. If pressure is a third of the
sea level pressure, as it happens for a flying aircraft, the ignition energy will be
