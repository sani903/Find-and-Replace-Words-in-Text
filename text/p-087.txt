rate further, the temperature of the flame reaches the adiabatic flame temperature.
This is termed ‘explosion’ to signify that the rates of heat generation are so large
that the balance occurs near the highest possible temperature. Returning to the
question of stability of flames in combustion chambers, the equation can be cast as
m

pr = f(A/F, Ty) (9.4)
Experiments of stability are conducted by first establishing a flame inside the com-
bustor at specific equivalence ratio and increasing the flow rate till the flame is
extinguished. It is useful to appreciate that the term ‘stability’ under the circum-
stances implies essentially stable equilibrium. A typical stability plot for a gas
turbine combustor is shown in Fig. 9.6. There are two branches to the curve—one
fuel-lean and another fuel-rich. The two curves meet at a region and beyond a cer-
tain value of 1 /vp”, the flame blows off. The exponent n is about 1.8 for kerosene—
air mixtures. One can notice that the operation of gas turbine combustor becomes
critical at low pressures when the parameter 7 /vp™ becomes indeed large and so
tends to blow off the flame. The volume of the chamber then has to be increased so
that one has a reasonable stable operating range of fuel flows at worst conditions,
namely highest altitude, lowest rpm of engine and flight velocity. Another interest-
ing way of interpreting the above relationship, particularly in the light of blow-off,
is as follows. The equation can be written as

mv ~ wf H/cp(Ty — To) (9.5)

m = pAV where pis the density, A is the representative cross-section of the chamber
and V is the representative velocity. v can then be written as v = Ad where d is a
