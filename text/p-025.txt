3 Chemistry and Stoichiometry

Stoichiometry implies the proportions of reacting elements in a chemical reaction.
Conventionally, it is used to refer to the ratio of oxidizer to fuel which just leads
to complete products of combustion. The important elements for consideration in a
combustion reaction are C and H for fuel and O for oxidizer. The complete products
are CO, and H>O. In the case of hydrocarbon combustion with air, if there is no ex-
cess of oxygen left with the products being COs, H,O and N, (inert), the proportion
of air to fuel is termed स्टोइकोमेट्रिक. More air than this leads to lean mixtures,
less air than this to rich mixtures. The स्टोइकोमेट्रिक reactions are represented
typically as

H2 + (1/2)02 — HO (3.1)
H2 + (1/2)0s + [79/(21 x 2)Na] — Hy0 + [79/(21 x 2) No] (3.2)
CHy + (3/2)02 — CO3 + HyO (3.3)

CHy + (3/2)04 + (79/21) X (3/2) Ny — COq + HO + (79/21) X (3/2) Ny (3.4)

In equation (3.1), one molecule of hydrogen reacts with half a molecule (!) of oxy-
gen to lead to one molecule of HO. The half molecule does not mean much except
for स्टोइकोमेट्रिक purposes. Since there are millions of molecules randomly moving
around in any gas, the statement is taken to mean that every 2 molecules of H,
react with one molecule of Oy and the product consists of 2 molecules of water. One
thing that must be understood is that the reaction never proceeds from reactants
to products the way shown in equations (3.1) to (3.4), but by much more complex
paths (see Chapter 5).

Another way of describing reaction (3.1) is that one mole of H, reacts with half
a mole of O; to give one mole of H>O. The word mole is taken to imply a molecular
weight equivalent of mass. That is, one mole of hydrogen implies approximately 2
grams of H2. Similarly, half a mole of oxygen implies (1/2)x32 = 16 grams (g) of
oxygen. Thus one can state the reaction 3.1 as: 2 g of hydrogen reacts with 16 g
of oxygen to give 18 g of water. Notice that there is mass conservation here. It is
one of the underlying principles of chemical reactions that no mass is created or
destroyed in a chemical reaction. Only the form of the species changes. It is also
to be noticed that there is no mole conservation. In fact, in reaction (3.1) the total
number of moles has gone down from one and a half to unity.
