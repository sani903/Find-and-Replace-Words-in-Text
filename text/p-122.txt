Well then, how does one overcome instability? What one needs to do is to ar-
range for the acoustic oscillations and energy release oscillations to be out of phase.
One way of achieving this is to distribute the energy release over a wider region
physically — not make it too concentrated. This will cause the energy to be put into
other regions of the oscillating wavesuch that the amplification factor due to in-
phase energy addition decreases. The injector holes are made little larger, pressure
drop is reduced so that the drop size distribution is made more coarse, and thus
combustion energy release is made broader. This method is adopted for overcoming
the oscillations in a few cases. Another method used raises the natural frequency
of excitable oscillations. For this purpose the injector is provided with radial and/or
circular baffles (see Fig. 12.5). Acoustic cavities are also provided so that the reso-
nant frequency oscillations of the chamber are absorbed and instability is avoided.
The last two techniques are used in many American liquid engines.

These methods are proved to work well by testing by what are known as bomb-
ing techniques. When the engine is running normally, a small bomb is exploded
into the chamber so that a small pressure spike is caused. Resulting pressure oscil-
