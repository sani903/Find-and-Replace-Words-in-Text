14.1 Fire spread rates on thin and thick sheets

This equation indicates that as the thickness of the sheet increases the propagation
speed decreases. This has been found experimentally valid. It also shows that the
flame propagation speed is independent of the wind speed. This is because the
thickness over which conduction takes place from flame and along the sheet are
taken to be of the same scale. A more rigorous analysis indicates this to be correct.

As an example, consider the combustion rate of a thin paper kept horizontally.
Typically, for bond paper and its combustion, we can set 7y=1800 K, 7p=300 K, T;,
= 600 K, t= 0.001 m. Introducing these into the expressiona above, we get V; =
21 m/h (~ 6 mm/s). The experimentally measured value is 18 m/h (you can do it
yourself at your home and find the value to be around this).

If fire spreading is occurring over a thick sheet, then the heat does not penetrate
all the thickness and it is not correct to assume that temperature is uniform across
the whole section. The extent of penetration of the heat wave can be estimated from

ty, =v 20st,

where oy is the thermal diffusivity of the solid and ¢ is the time where t = Az /V, =
kq/pgcpVs. Substituting the value of ¢), in eqn. (14.2) we get

Vs = Vy (TT)? ((Ty - To) /(T, - T,))?, (14.3)

where I'y = pycpky, I's = ppcpks. These are called thermal responsivity or thermal
inertia of the gas and the solid fuel.

Thus in the case of a thick fuel; the propagation speed is proportional to wind
speed and does not depend on the thickness. This result is also confirmed by exper-
iments. The dependence on pressure appears largely through the term p, in re, a
result again supported by experiments.

The result obtained earlier can be used for estimating the rate of spread of the
flame down thick sheets as may happen in a situation of fire. The velocity V;,, which
would be a known velocity in case of wind flowing past, is now identified as free
convective driven velocity and is obtained as follows.

The balance between convective term and the body-force related acceleration
due to free convection gives
