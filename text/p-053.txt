Thus one can see nine reversible reactions in the simplest case. The reaction system
is called a chain reaction. One can notice a species like HO, called hydroperoxyl
being present. It is a species present at relatively low temperature, nevertheless
important. One can notice that the other active species and radicals are H, O,
and OH. The various s in the chain reaction are characterized differently. The
two initial s when active species are generated from initial reactants are called
chain initiation s. Then we have chain branching reactions where more radicals
and active intermediates are generated. The chain termination step is the step
where final products get produced and radicals are used up.

The reaction rate is now understood to be due to collisions—largely between two
molecules (called bimolecular). This means the rate of reaction is proportional to
concentration of molecules of each of the participants—higher pressure implying
higher concentrations, linearly. Thus

Reaction rate (RR) = AX; Xop? (5.1)

where X;, X, are the mole fractions of colliding species.

Next we examine the dependence of the reaction rate on temperature. It is to
be recalled that energetic collisions are responsible for a reaction. It is not the
molecules with mean energy that matter, but those with much larger energy levels.
It implies that one can set a threshold value of energy E which must be exceeded for
