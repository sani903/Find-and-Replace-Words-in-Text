4 How Much Heat? How High a Temperature?

atmosphere. By putting up a heat exchanger to heat the air for combustion, such
industries would have derived enormous financial benefit and would have saved the
planet considerable fuel! Of course, they can effect the changes even now.

4.6 Overview

We have discussed in this chapter the essential elements of chemical thermodynam-
ics. The science of this area is well developed and understood. Powerful computer
programmes for the calculation of adiabatic flame properties are available. The
measured temperatures of flames in actual situations is lower due to stretch effects
as well as heat loss. Increasing the peak combustion temperatures can be achieved
by using a separate combustor to preheat the reactants if the process concerned
does not have an exhaust (waste) stream at high temperature.

Equilibrium adiabatic flame temperature sets the upper limit of observed flame
temperature for most systems—gaseous oxidizer, fuel; solid propellant, liquid bipro-
pellants. There is one important exception in some liquid monopropellants—one ex-
ample being hydrazine. In this case, the measured decomposition temperature ex-
ceeds the adiabatic flame temperature. The reason lies in the fact that ammonia—
one of the products decomposes endothermically very slowly to Ny and Hs. Thus in
an actual system decomposition is partial and not complete. This leads to a slightly
better performance in terms of 7, and c* in the actual system compared to equilib-
rium conditions.
