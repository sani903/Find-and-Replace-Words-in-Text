isation, to form fine droplets. The swirl injector is used in gas turbine combustors,
liquid rocket engines, burners for furnaces and even in the spray used in a hair
dressing shop!

In case (a), the flame is stabilized as a cylindrical flame. It appears bluish in
the case of LPG at some flow rates. The flame is stable over a wide range of air-to-
fuel ratios, typically a factor of four. This factor is also called the turn-down ratio.
The interpretation of this term is somewhat similar to the one stated earlier. For
fixed air flow rate, the lowest flow rate is one at which the flame blows off and the
highest flow rate is one at which the flame occurs significantly outside the burner
(or incomplete combustion occurs inside the burner). The ratio of highest-to-lowest
fuel rates then becomes the turn-down ratio.

13.3 Combustion Chambers

The swirl combustion chamber shown in Fig. 13.5 (b) corresponds typically to a gas
turbine combustor. The fuel and air injection regions are similar to the burner used
in a furnace. Only the casing with holes present in the gas turbine combustor is
