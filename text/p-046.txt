Fuel Oxidizer Pressure Initial Peak
MPa Temp K Temp K
Methane Air 0.1 300 2210
Methane Air 2.0 300 2270
Methane Air 2.0 600 2500
Methane Oxygen 0.1 300 3030
Methane Oxygen 2.0 300 3460
Hydrogen Air 0.1 300 2400
Hydrogen Oxygen 0.1 300 3080
Acetylene Air 0.1 300 2600
Acetylene Oxygen 0.1 300 3400
Carbon monoxide Air 0.1 300 2400
Butane Air 0.1 300 2250
Kerosene Air 0.1 300 2270
Producer gas Air 0.1 300 1500
Wood (dry) Air 0.1 300 1900

 

Producer gas and wood are low-energy fuels compared to hydrocarbons. Pro-
ducer gas has about one-tenth the heat of combustion of kerosene on weight basis.
Since it needs little air to burn stoichiometrically, it still can raise the temperature
to a significant value (~ 1500 K). Wood (dry) has a calorific value of about 16-20
M J/kg, being a little more than one-third that of kerosene; it also has oxygen in it.
It needs about six and a half times its weight of air to combust stoichiometrically
and ideally attains a temperature of1900 K.

Combustion properties of three typical examples of rocket engine systems are
shown in Fig. 4.3(a) and 4.3(b). The figures show the plot of 7, .#, v and a quantity
called ¢* with oxidizer/fuel for a solid propellant as well as two liquid propellant
combinations. ¢* is called the characteristic velocity. It is given by

cc" =/RT;/(AT(7)) (4.23)

where I'(y) is a function of the ratio of specific heats (~1.2) and is about 0.62.

Higher ¢* means better performance of a rocket propellant combination. It has
an interestingly curious dependence on (7; /.#). This increase in performance does
not necessarily have to take place by an increase in 7. It can also be accomplished
by decrease in .#Z. Whereas in the case of solid propellant (not shown here) as well
as UDMH-N,0, liquid propellant, the peak in T; corresponds roughly to peak in c*
implying that molecular weight variation does not play a major role, in the case of
liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen (LH,— LOX) system, variation in .# plays a signifi-
cant role. As can be noticed, .#y, = 2 and .#y;,0 = 18; the average molecular weight
varies between 8 and 18 in the figure. Since this variation is large, making the
