12 Combustion in Rocket Motors

One of the common subjects associated with the development of solid propellant
rocket engine concerns the burn rate of the propellant and mechanical integrity of
the propellant grain, as it is called. Figure 12.1 shows the way a propellant is ar-
ranged in an engine and how the burning takes place. Most motors need to pack
the propellant in as small a volume as possible and yet generate a high burning
surface to obtain the desired thrust. An n-pointed internal star (see figure) is a fa-
miliar configuration to acieve this. It is instructive to see the relationship between
the thrust produced and other parameters. The thrust produced is a product of the
mass flow rate through the nozzle and the exit speed (following Newton's laws).
The mass flow rate is that produced by the combustion of the propellant and we can
write,

F =1mV, = pi A, Ve

where p, = density of the propellant, A; the burning surface area and r, the linear
burning rate (the variation of the movement of the surface along a local normal,
y with time, see Fig. 12.1). The exit velocity can be shown to be a product of Â¢*,
the characteristic velocity and thrust coefficient (cr) which indicates the amount
by which the characteristic velocity is amplified by expansion through the nozzle
(typically 1.2 to 1.6). Thus
