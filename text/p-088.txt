representative dimension of the chamber. If, in addition, we take H = ¢,(T — Tp),
we get
Vid=1if/p or t;'=t (9.6)

d/V can be taken as the travel time ¢; of the fluid over the length d, and (@'/ p)~!
can be taken as time taken for completing reaction t.;,. Thus the previous result
can be stated as ty = t.,. If t; is very small, something which can be achieved by
raising the velocities, there will be very little time for reaction and so the flame
blows off. The ratio t;/t.,, = D; is called first Damkdohler number and is a very
important parameter in combustion studies. D; — oo represents the limit of fast
chemical reactions and the attainment of equilibrium. D; — 0 represents the limit
of little time for reaction (or very slow reaction) and is called frozen limit implying
little change of composition during the passage of the gases through the combustion
